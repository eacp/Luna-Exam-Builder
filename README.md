# Luna Exam Builder

This is an aplication designed to help teachers or every person in general to create multiple quizzes with just one click. It can randomly generate many versions of an exam by just entering the individual questions with its options. 

## History
The first version of this application was a class project for a contest when I was in High School back in May 2017. The application got me the first place. The first version was very sinple and only printed the exams in the screen, and only allowed 4 choices per question. Then I decided to continue the project in my free time to help people who might like to use this toool. I continued to develop it until this day.
